# Popular Movies App Project

First Project for Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree by Google.

The goal of this project was to build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
Users can browse through the most popular movies, the top rated movies, or even save movies to their own favourites list that they can browse offline.

In order to try this app you need an API key from The Movie Database (TMDb).
